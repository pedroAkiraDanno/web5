## --How it's structured--
The markup is simple. It is separated into three parts. A header, main content, and a footer. The main content is made of a grid that responsively changes depending on the viewport width. The header is also a grid combined with flexbox children for easy alignment. The footer is a flexbox in itself. 
## --About me--

Hello! My name is Sebastian, and I'm a high-school student from Sweden. I have dabbled with some front-end development for the past few months. And since Christmas brake finally arrived, I've decided to start a challenge for myself! I'm going to code for the coming 20 days.

I'm following the front-end career path at Scrimba and I'm currently at module 8 (Flexbox, Grid and Fetch)

By the end of the 20 days I'm hoping to have finished the front-end career path and have started with some backend Node.js development. I will be documenting my progress for the coming days, and filming myself on my Youtube-channel, so feel free to follow along my journey and learn with me!
